# Breaktime

A small [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) app for reminding you to take breaks.

No sounds are provided by default. You must add them to the `assets/` folder and update the `alarmSource` in [Settings](./lib/screens/settings.dart) to one of the files added to the `assets` folder.

## Running locally

After cloning the repo, you can start a dev build by running `flutter run`.
